# Introduction of this game


Alien vs. Zombie is basically a role-play game that needs the path-planning and strategy of the players. In this game, players must defeat all the zombies that are hunting for the alien itself in order to achieve victory for this game. Therefore, set a trail and prepare the way to protect the alien from those zombies as every way matters!


There are some mysterious game objects such as rocks, arrow power, pod attack power and others that can help the alien become stronger in order to attack the zombies.
